/*
 * All this does is identify tokens.
 * Questions about the meanings of those tokens or their acceptable order or anything else are matters for the parser.
 * The lexer will say: I have found another token and have identified it as being of some type T.
 * Hence, for each recognized token, the lexer will produce two items:
 * The type of the token
 * The value of the token
 * 
 * Create class token. 
 * Contains type of token
 * and value
 * Creates an array of values of type token.
